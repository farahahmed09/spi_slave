# spi_slave
•	Developed Verilog-based digital design module for interfacing an SPI slave module with a RAM memory.
•	 Implemented SPI communication protocol, handling data reception, decoding instructions, and performing operations on the RAM. Achieved synchronization between clock and data signals. Verified module functionality through simulation tests. Deliverables: Verilog code, testbenches, and documentation.
